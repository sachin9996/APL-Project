 INTRODUCTION
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 	This Project takes a directed graph as input, and produces a partition of the graph's vertices into the graph's strongly connected components using Tarjan's Algorithm. Each vertex of the graph appears in exactly one of the strongly connected components. Any vertex that is not on a directed cycle forms a strongly connected component all by itself: 
 	for example, a vertex whose in-degree or out-degree is 0, or any vertex of an acyclic graph. 
 	
 BASIC DESCRIPTION OF TARJAN'S ALGORITHM:
 	 A depth-first search begins from an arbitrary start node (and subsequent depth-first searches are conducted on any nodes that have not yet been found). As usual with depth-first search, the search visits every node of the graph exactly once, declining to revisit any node that has already been explored. Thus, the collection of search trees is a spanning forest of the graph. The strongly connected components will be recovered as certain subtrees of this forest. The roots of these subtrees are called the "roots" of the strongly connected components. Any node of a strongly connected component might serve as the root, if it happens to be the first node of the component that is discovered by the search.
 	 
 	The output is a video file which shows step by step animation of visiting each node, isolating the strongly connected components by visiting the nodes and shows the final output at the end.
 	
REQUIRED MODULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following python modules/libraries are required to execute the program:
 	1.graphviz
 	2.matplotlib
 	3.cv2
 	4.random
 	5.random_graph
 	6.functools
 	7.sys

DETAILS OF OTHER FILES IN THE FOLDER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
animation.py:
			It serves as a custom animation file for the program. It reads the graph images generated by tarjan.py and starts an animation video which displays the images in sequence with a fixed frame rate.
			
aux_data.py:
			It has a class named data which takes a name and stores it in the class variable 'name'.

graph.py:
		 This file is for creating a graph from the given input in the test_graph and dispaying it in the form of an image.It accepts input in the following format:
n m 
u1 v1 
u2 v2
...
...
um vm

where, 

n-> number of vertices m-> number of edges
ui vi -> indicates a direct edge from ui to vi
It returns the graph,no.of vertices and no.of edges.
		The displaying function takes a graph and a target file name and converts the graoh into an image and creates and writes it in the target file and saves it in the same directory. 
		
graphviz_elements.py:
					It defines the classes for basic elements of the graph- edges and nodes with various information like label,colour,data,style,direction etc.
					
gzutilities.py:
			   It defines the style class for each node and edge. It defines some important functions required for the programs- adding nodes to the graph and applying UI styles to the graph.
			   
main.py:
		This is the main function for the project. It calls other functions from other files. It generates a random graph(with number of edges=15 and nodes=10), applies tarjan's algoritm and displays the final animated video file.
		
random_graph.py:
				It generates a random graph used as an input file for the program with the given number of vertices and edges. The default number of edges and nodes are 18 and 10 respectively. 

tarjan.py:
		  This file contains the program for running tarjan's algorithm on a graph. It generates graph images while visiting each new node with appropriate colours required for the animation.
		  
EXECUTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The program should be executed in command line by the following command: python main.py
	
It takes the randomly generated test graph, applies tarjan's algorithm on it and displays the final result as a step by step animation of implementing the algorithm which produces the graph with isolated strongly connected components as the final result.
